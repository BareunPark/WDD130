  <h2>Bareun Park</h2>
  <p>I am from Korea. I currently live with my wife near Seoul, the capital of Korea.</p>
  <p>I haven't thought of what I will do with my education yet. I will see how things go this semester. </p>
  <p>I have no background in programming, so I am 100 percent sure that I will be struggling a lot. </p>
  <p>The reason I am taking this course is that I have been always interested in web designing since when I was young. </p>
  <p>I finally got a chance to study it by chance. I have been a member of the Church for about 4 years. </p>
